Thank-you for purchasing Easy Save 2, and supporting the Unity scene.

##### Important Note to Unity 3.5 Users #####
If using Unity 3.5, you must delete both the 'Plugins/Metro' folder and the 'Plugins/WP8' folder, otherwise you will receive an Internal Compiler Error.

##### Important Note to Android Users ##### 

Your application needs the correct permissions set to be able to save to device. 
To set these, go to: 

Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Android Tab -> Other Settings -> Configuration -> Force SD Card permission.

##### Important Note to iOS Users ##### 

If using 'Strip ByteCode', you must place the 'link.xml' file supplied with Easy Save into your Assets folder.
'Use micro mscorlib' does not work with Easy Save as it contains no File I/O functionality.

##### Important Note to those using Encryption #####

If using encryption it may be necessary to declare that you are using encryption in certain countries.
For example, you will be asked if you are using encryption when submitting an app to the Apple App Store.

If you are not using encryption, and you do not wish to declare this, you should replace the blank MoodkieSecurity.dll file
supplied with Easy Save 2 with the MoodkieSecurity.dll found at http://www.moodkie.com/easysavedownloads/MoodkieSecurity.dll.

##### PlayMaker Users #####

You can enable the Easy Save Playmaker actions by unzipping the ES2PlayMakerAction.zip file supplied with Easy Save, and dragging the unzipped file into the Playmaker 'Actions' folder.
